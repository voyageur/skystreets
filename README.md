# skystreets

Remake of classic DOS game SkyRoads, originally developed at http://skystreets.kaosfusion.com/ and saved in this repository.

Some basic changes to make it compile are in after the last version from original maintainer.

### Installation

You need SDL 1.2 and relevant devel files.
Run autoreconf, then "./configure && make" should do the trick
