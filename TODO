:Fix throttling problem (DONE)
:Fix annoying tail problem (tail not being accounted for when figuring out floors)(DONE)

:Add in complete text rendering system (requires usable font block) (DONE)
=Redo menu with new text system(DONE, but needs tweaking)

(MAYBE)Software Renderer?
=Find out why explosion sound is inconsistent
=Add shadows (DONE, but could do with improvement - stencil buffer)
-Change level ending to have camera rotate around ship
=Improve render speed - probably vertex arrays (Most important in Level::Render, which is 45.5% of the running time)(DONE);
