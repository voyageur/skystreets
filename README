Please read this document, it will only take a moment....  (And the GNU docs say
I can assume that you've read this. So read it.) (And I know this project isn't
actually  GNU,	but   their   standards   make	 sense,   so   I   use	 them)

Install instructions are in INSTALL, but it's pretty standard  -  ./configure,
make, make install. 

At the moment, controls are hardcoded. Up and down arrow keys control you speed,
left and right control movement.  Space is to jump,  as well as make a selection
in the menus. Escape will drop you back to the menu. When you return to the game
things may be a little weird (framerate, timing, you may  be  out  of  oxygen)

One other thing, regarding spelling.  I'm  Australian,	so  I  use  Australian
spellings in my code and documentation. This is very similar to British English,
but not quite the same.  Just try to ignore it.  However, if you think	you've
spotted an actual typo, feel free to send me an email so that I can correct it.

If you want any files that you think I may have, but aren't in the distribution
like the base skin for the ship (the uncoloured version) or the ship model, or
anything  like	that,  go  ahead  and  email  me,  I'll  make  it   available.
